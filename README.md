# PathProgramming

This project compares the performance of BFS, Greedy, and A* algorithms on grid maps of different sizes.

## Features

- Implementation of BFS, Greedy, and A* algorithms in Python.
- Testing on maps of sizes 300x300, 600x600, and 900x900.
- Metrics measured: solution time, path length, and iterations.

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository.
2. Ensure Python is installed.
3. Run the `PathProgramming.py` script to compare algorithms on different maps.

For more details and analysis, refer to the project code.
